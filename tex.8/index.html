  <div class="text">
    <p> The following example<a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/meta-balls/">"Meta-Balls"</a>,
      shows how to create visual interactions with your mouse using an array of points.
      Some changes I made to this example were chaning the color and size of the circles. I
      also added more points to the array of circles and changed the distance
      that these points were able to interract with the mouse.

    <p>This second example, <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/rounded-rectangles/">
        "Rounded Rectangles"</a> from paper.js shows how to create an array of rounded
      rectangles that follows the mouse crusor so that it creates and
      "optical illusion" - like pattern. I changed serveral things in this example,
      I added a the color black to the orginal colors of red, white,and blue. I also
      changed the size of the rounded rectangles which turned them into circles. I also
      changed the distance between each shape in the array.
