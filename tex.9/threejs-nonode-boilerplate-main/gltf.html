    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an example of a three.js scene that makes use of a glTF 3D model.
      I chose this loader because glTF models are the preferred format for
      online 3D model display. <br />
      <br />I formated this based on the code you provided on GitHub. This is a 3D model based on the shape of a flower I made for this example.<br />
